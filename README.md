# POSHAN
We are creating a solution for the attendence system under the PM POSHAN scheme

 PM POSHAN is a mid-day meal programme for giving one hot cooked and nutritious meal to students of class 1 to 8 in all Government and Government-aided schools. 

These meals are given once every day in school during school days.
It is mandated that each child should get 450 calories and 12 grams protein at primary level and 700 calories and 20 grams protein at upper primary level per day. 
Third party evaluation has shown that this programme has a positive impact in retention of students in schools.

We are tracking each child attendance and taking of POSHAN and the Nutritional Values.

During our site visit, we gathered some pictures of the meals being served and used it to train our model.
